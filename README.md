### Hi, I'm Brandon 👋
I'm a front-end web developer and designer. I'm passionate about UI/UX design and making applications simpler, more accessible, and more effective.

On the side, I enjoy experimenting with new tech and homebrewing build tools, libraries, and frameworks to optimize efficiency and scalability in my own code. I'm also a hobbyist game developer and digital artist.
